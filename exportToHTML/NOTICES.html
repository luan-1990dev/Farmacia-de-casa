   <span class="s0">2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of</span>
      <span class="s0">this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,</span>

   <span class="s0">3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of</span>
      <span class="s0">this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,</span>
      <span class="s0">worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable</span>

      <span class="s0">use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,</span>
      <span class="s0">where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable</span>
      <span class="s0">by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their</span>
      <span class="s0">Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)</span>

      <span class="s0">institute patent litigation against any entity (including a</span>
      <span class="s0">cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work</span>
      <span class="s0">or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct</span>
      <span class="s0">or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses</span>
      <span class="s0">granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate</span>
      <span class="s0">as of the date such litigation is filed.</span>

   <span class="s0">4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the</span>
      <span class="s0">Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without</span>
      <span class="s0">modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You</span>
      <span class="s0">meet the following conditions:</span>

      <span class="s0">(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or</span>
          <span class="s0">Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</span>

      <span class="s0">(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices</span>
          <span class="s0">stating that You changed the files; and</span>

      <span class="s0">(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works</span>
          <span class="s0">that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and</span>
          <span class="s0">attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,</span>
          <span class="s0">excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of</span>
          <span class="s0">the Derivative Works; and</span>

      <span class="s0">(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its</span>
          <span class="s0">distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must</span>
          <span class="s0">include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained</span>
          <span class="s0">within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not</span>
          <span class="s0">pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one</span>
          <span class="s0">of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed</span>
          <span class="s0">as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or</span>
          <span class="s0">documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,</span>
          <span class="s0">within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and</span>
          <span class="s0">wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents</span>
          <span class="s0">of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and</span>
          <span class="s0">do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution</span>
          <span class="s0">notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside</span>
          <span class="s0">or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided</span>
          <span class="s0">that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed</span>
          <span class="s0">as modifying the License.</span>

      <span class="s0">You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and</span>
      <span class="s0">may provide additional or different license terms and conditions</span>
      <span class="s0">for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or</span>
      <span class="s0">for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,</span>
      <span class="s0">reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with</span>
      <span class="s0">the conditions stated in this License.</span>

   <span class="s0">5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,</span>
      <span class="s0">any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work</span>
      <span class="s0">by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of</span>
      <span class="s0">this License, without any additional terms or conditions.</span>
      <span class="s0">Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify</span>
      <span class="s0">the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed</span>
      <span class="s0">with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</span>

   <span class="s0">6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade</span>
      <span class="s0">names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,</span>
      <span class="s0">except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the</span>
      <span class="s0">origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</span>

   <span class="s0">7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or</span>
      <span class="s0">agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each</span>
      <span class="s0">Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,</span>
      <span class="s0">WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or</span>
      <span class="s0">implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions</span>
      <span class="s0">of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A</span>
      <span class="s0">PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the</span>
      <span class="s0">appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any</span>
      <span class="s0">risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</span>

   <span class="s0">8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,</span>
      <span class="s0">whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,</span>
      <span class="s0">unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly</span>
      <span class="s0">negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be</span>
      <span class="s0">liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,</span>
      <span class="s0">incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a</span>
      <span class="s0">result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the</span>
      <span class="s0">Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,</span>
      <span class="s0">work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all</span>
      <span class="s0">other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor</span>
      <span class="s0">has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</span>

   <span class="s0">9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing</span>
      <span class="s0">the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,</span>
      <span class="s0">and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,</span>
      <span class="s0">or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this</span>
      <span class="s0">License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only</span>
      <span class="s0">on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf</span>
      <span class="s0">of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,</span>
      <span class="s0">defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability</span>
      <span class="s0">incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason</span>
      <span class="s0">of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</span>

   <span class="s0">END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</span>

      <span class="s0">worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable</span>
      <span class="s0">copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,</span>
      <span class="s0">publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the</span>
      <span class="s0">Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</span>

   <span class="s0">3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of</span>
      <span class="s0">this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,</span>

      <span class="s0">or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct</span>
      <span class="s0">or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses</span>
      <span class="s0">granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate</span>
      <span class="s0">as of the date such litigation is filed.</span>

   <span class="s0">4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the</span>
      <span class="s0">Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without</span>

      <span class="s0">(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices</span>
          <span class="s0">stating that You changed the files; and</span>

          <span class="s0">excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of</span>
          <span class="s0">the Derivative Works; and</span>

      <span class="s0">(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its</span>
          <span class="s0">distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must</span>
          <span class="s0">include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained</span>

          <span class="s0">of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed</span>
          <span class="s0">as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or</span>
          <span class="s0">documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,</span>
          <span class="s0">within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and</span>
          <span class="s0">wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents</span>
          <span class="s0">of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and</span>
          <span class="s0">do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution</span>
          <span class="s0">notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside</span>
          <span class="s0">or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided</span>
          <span class="s0">that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed</span>
          <span class="s0">as modifying the License.</span>

      <span class="s0">You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and</span>
      <span class="s0">may provide additional or different license terms and conditions</span>
      <span class="s0">for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or</span>
      <span class="s0">for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,</span>
      <span class="s0">reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with</span>
      <span class="s0">the conditions stated in this License.</span>

   <span class="s0">5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,</span>
      <span class="s0">any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work</span>
      <span class="s0">by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of</span>
      <span class="s0">this License, without any additional terms or conditions.</span>
      <span class="s0">Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify</span>
      <span class="s0">the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed</span>
      <span class="s0">with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</span>

   <span class="s0">6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade</span>
      <span class="s0">names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,</span>
      <span class="s0">except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the</span>
      <span class="s0">origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</span>

   <span class="s0">7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or</span>
      <span class="s0">agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each</span>
      <span class="s0">Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,</span>
      <span class="s0">WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or</span>
      <span class="s0">implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions</span>
      <span class="s0">of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A</span>
      <span class="s0">PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the</span>
      <span class="s0">appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any</span>
      <span class="s0">risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</span>

   <span class="s0">8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,</span>
      <span class="s0">whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,</span>
      <span class="s0">unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly</span>
      <span class="s0">negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be</span>
      <span class="s0">liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,</span>
      <span class="s0">incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a</span>
      <span class="s0">result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the</span>
      <span class="s0">Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,</span>
      <span class="s0">work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all</span>
      <span class="s0">other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor</span>
      <span class="s0">has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</span>

   <span class="s0">9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing</span>
      <span class="s0">the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,</span>
      <span class="s0">and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,</span>
      <span class="s0">or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this</span>
      <span class="s0">License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only</span>
      <span class="s0">on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf</span>
      <span class="s0">of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,</span>
      <span class="s0">defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability</span>
      <span class="s0">incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason</span>
      <span class="s0">of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</span>

   <span class="s0">END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</span>

<span class="s0">provided in the Appendix below).</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object </span>
<span class="s0">form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the </span>
<span class="s0">editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications </span>
<span class="s0">represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes </span>
<span class="s0">of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain </span>
<span class="s0">separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, </span>
<span class="s0">the Work and Derivative Works thereof.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including the original </span>

<span class="s0">the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot; means any form of electronic, </span>

<span class="s0">a Contribution.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on </span>
<span class="s0">behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently </span>

<span class="s0">2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this </span>
<span class="s0">License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, </span>
<span class="s0">non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to </span>
<span class="s0">reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, </span>
<span class="s0">sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or </span>
<span class="s0">Object form.</span>

<span class="s0">3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this </span>
<span class="s0">License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, </span>

<span class="s0">this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, </span>
<span class="s0">import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to </span>
<span class="s0">those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily </span>
<span class="s0">infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their </span>
<span class="s0">Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. </span>
<span class="s0">If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim</span>
<span class="s0">or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution </span>
<span class="s0">incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent </span>
<span class="s0">infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License </span>
<span class="s0">for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</span>

<span class="s0">4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or </span>
<span class="s0">Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and </span>
<span class="s0">in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:</span>

<span class="s0">You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of </span>
<span class="s0">this License; and</span>
<span class="s0">You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that </span>
<span class="s0">You changed the files; and</span>
<span class="s0">You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You </span>
<span class="s0">distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices </span>
<span class="s0">from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not </span>
<span class="s0">pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and</span>
<span class="s0">If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its distribution, </span>
<span class="s0">then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable </span>
<span class="s0">copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding</span>
<span class="s0">those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in</span>
<span class="s0">at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed </span>
<span class="s0">as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if </span>
<span class="s0">provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by </span>
<span class="s0">the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally </span>
<span class="s0">appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes </span>
<span class="s0">only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution </span>
<span class="s0">notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as </span>
<span class="s0">an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional </span>
<span class="s0">attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. </span>

<span class="s0">You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide</span>
<span class="s0">additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or</span>
<span class="s0">distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a </span>
<span class="s0">whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise </span>
<span class="s0">complies with the conditions stated in this License.</span>
<span class="s0">5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any </span>
<span class="s0">Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the </span>
<span class="s0">Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any </span>
<span class="s0">additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein </span>
<span class="s0">shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you </span>
<span class="s0">may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</span>

<span class="s0">6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, </span>
<span class="s0">trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as </span>
<span class="s0">required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the </span>
<span class="s0">Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</span>

<span class="s0">7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to </span>
<span class="s0">in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its </span>
<span class="s0">Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF </span>
<span class="s0">ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any </span>
<span class="s0">warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or </span>
<span class="s0">FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining </span>
<span class="s0">the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks </span>
<span class="s0">associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</span>

<span class="s0">8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in</span>
<span class="s0">tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by </span>
<span class="s0">applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to </span>
<span class="s0">in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including </span>
<span class="s0">any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any </span>
<span class="s0">character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability </span>
<span class="s0">to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, </span>
<span class="s0">work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other </span>
<span class="s0">commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised </span>
<span class="s0">of the possibility of such damages.</span>

<span class="s0">9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the </span>
<span class="s0">Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a </span>
<span class="s0">fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability </span>
<span class="s0">obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting</span>
<span class="s0">such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole </span>
<span class="s0">responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You</span>
<span class="s0">agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any </span>
<span class="s0">liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by </span>
<span class="s0">reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</span>

<span class="s0">non-exclusive license:</span>

<span class="s0">(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)</span>
    <span class="s0">Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,</span>
    <span class="s0">modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its</span>

<span class="s0">2.2. Effective Date</span>

<span class="s0">The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution</span>
<span class="s0">become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first</span>
<span class="s0">distributes such Contribution.</span>

<span class="s0">2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope</span>

<span class="s0">The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under</span>
<span class="s0">this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the</span>
<span class="s0">distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.</span>
<span class="s0">Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a</span>
<span class="s0">Contributor:</span>

    <span class="s0">modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its</span>

    <span class="s0">Version); or</span>

<span class="s0">(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of</span>
    <span class="s0">its Contributions.</span>

<span class="s0">This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,</span>

<span class="s0">the notice requirements in Section 3.4).</span>

<span class="s0">2.4. Subsequent Licenses</span>

<span class="s0">No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to</span>
<span class="s0">distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this</span>
<span class="s0">License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if</span>
<span class="s0">permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).</span>

<span class="s0">2.5. Representation</span>

<span class="s0">Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its</span>
<span class="s0">Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights</span>
<span class="s0">to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.</span>

<span class="s0">2.6. Fair Use</span>

<span class="s0">This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under</span>
<span class="s0">applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other</span>
<span class="s0">equivalents.</span>

<span class="s0">2.7. Conditions</span>

<span class="s0">Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted</span>

<span class="s0">3. Responsibilities</span>
<span class="s0">-------------------</span>

<span class="s0">3.1. Distribution of Source Form</span>

<span class="s0">All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any</span>
<span class="s0">Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under</span>
<span class="s0">the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source</span>
<span class="s0">Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this</span>
<span class="s0">License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not</span>
<span class="s0">attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code</span>
<span class="s0">Form.</span>

<span class="s0">3.2. Distribution of Executable Form</span>

<span class="s0">If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:</span>

<span class="s0">(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code</span>
    <span class="s0">Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of</span>
    <span class="s0">the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code</span>
    <span class="s0">Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more</span>
    <span class="s0">than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and</span>

<span class="s0">(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this</span>
    <span class="s0">License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the</span>
    <span class="s0">license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter</span>
    <span class="s0">the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.</span>

<span class="s0">3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work</span>

<span class="s0">You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,</span>
<span class="s0">provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for</span>
<span class="s0">the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered</span>
<span class="s0">Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the</span>
<span class="s0">Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this</span>
<span class="s0">License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software</span>
<span class="s0">under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of</span>
<span class="s0">the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered</span>
<span class="s0">Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary</span>
<span class="s0">License(s).</span>

<span class="s0">3.4. Notices</span>

<span class="s0">You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices</span>
<span class="s0">(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,</span>
<span class="s0">or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of</span>
<span class="s0">the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to</span>
<span class="s0">the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.</span>

<span class="s0">3.5. Application of Additional Terms</span>

<span class="s0">You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,</span>
<span class="s0">indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered</span>
<span class="s0">Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on</span>
<span class="s0">behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any</span>
<span class="s0">such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by</span>
<span class="s0">You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any</span>
<span class="s0">liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,</span>
<span class="s0">indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional</span>
<span class="s0">disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any</span>
<span class="s0">jurisdiction.</span>

<span class="s0">4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation</span>
<span class="s0">---------------------------------------------------</span>

<span class="s0">If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this</span>
<span class="s0">License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to</span>
<span class="s0">statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with</span>
<span class="s0">the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)</span>
<span class="s0">describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must</span>
<span class="s0">be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered</span>
<span class="s0">Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute</span>
<span class="s0">or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a</span>
<span class="s0">recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.</span>

<span class="s0">5. Termination</span>
<span class="s0">--------------</span>

<span class="s0">5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically</span>
<span class="s0">if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become</span>
<span class="s0">compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular</span>
<span class="s0">Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such</span>
<span class="s0">Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an</span>
<span class="s0">ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the</span>
<span class="s0">non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have</span>
<span class="s0">come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular</span>
<span class="s0">Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor</span>
<span class="s0">notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the</span>
<span class="s0">first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License</span>
<span class="s0">from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after</span>
<span class="s0">Your receipt of the notice.</span>

<span class="s0">5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent</span>
<span class="s0">infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,</span>
<span class="s0">counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version</span>
<span class="s0">directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to</span>
<span class="s0">You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section</span>
<span class="s0">2.1 of this License shall terminate.</span>

<span class="s0">5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all</span>
<span class="s0">end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which</span>
<span class="s0">have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License</span>
<span class="s0">prior to termination shall survive termination.</span>

<span class="s0">unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent</span>
<span class="s0">necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides</span>
<span class="s0">that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter</span>

<span class="s0">any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that</span>
<span class="s0">such modified license differs from this License).</span>

      <span class="s0">with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You</span>
      <span class="s0">institute patent litigation against any entity (including a</span>
      <span class="s0">cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work</span>
      <span class="s0">or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct</span>
      <span class="s0">or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses</span>
      <span class="s0">granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate</span>
      <span class="s0">as of the date such litigation is filed.</span>

   <span class="s0">4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the</span>
      <span class="s0">Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without</span>
      <span class="s0">modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You</span>
      <span class="s0">meet the following conditions:</span>

      <span class="s0">(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or</span>
          <span class="s0">Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</span>

      <span class="s0">(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices</span>
          <span class="s0">stating that You changed the files; and</span>

      <span class="s0">(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works</span>
          <span class="s0">that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and</span>
          <span class="s0">attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,</span>
          <span class="s0">excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of</span>
          <span class="s0">the Derivative Works; and</span>

      <span class="s0">(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its</span>
          <span class="s0">distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must</span>
          <span class="s0">include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained</span>
          <span class="s0">within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not</span>
          <span class="s0">pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one</span>
          <span class="s0">of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed</span>
          <span class="s0">as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or</span>
          <span class="s0">documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,</span>
          <span class="s0">within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and</span>
          <span class="s0">wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents</span>
          <span class="s0">of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and</span>
          <span class="s0">do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution</span>
          <span class="s0">notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside</span>
          <span class="s0">or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided</span>
          <span class="s0">that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed</span>
          <span class="s0">as modifying the License.</span>

      <span class="s0">You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and</span>
      <span class="s0">may provide additional or different license terms and conditions</span>
      <span class="s0">for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or</span>
      <span class="s0">for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,</span>
      <span class="s0">reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with</span>
      <span class="s0">the conditions stated in this License.</span>

   <span class="s0">5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,</span>
      <span class="s0">any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work</span>
      <span class="s0">by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of</span>
      <span class="s0">this License, without any additional terms or conditions.</span>
      <span class="s0">Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify</span>
      <span class="s0">the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed</span>
      <span class="s0">with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</span>

   <span class="s0">6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade</span>
      <span class="s0">names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,</span>
      <span class="s0">except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the</span>
      <span class="s0">origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</span>

   <span class="s0">7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or</span>
      <span class="s0">agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each</span>
      <span class="s0">Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,</span>
      <span class="s0">WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or</span>
      <span class="s0">implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions</span>
      <span class="s0">of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A</span>
      <span class="s0">PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the</span>
      <span class="s0">appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any</span>
      <span class="s0">risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</span>

   <span class="s0">8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,</span>
      <span class="s0">whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,</span>
      <span class="s0">unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly</span>
      <span class="s0">negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be</span>
      <span class="s0">liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,</span>
      <span class="s0">incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a</span>
      <span class="s0">result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the</span>
      <span class="s0">Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,</span>
      <span class="s0">work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all</span>
      <span class="s0">other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor</span>
      <span class="s0">has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</span>

   <span class="s0">9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing</span>
      <span class="s0">the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,</span>
      <span class="s0">and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,</span>
      <span class="s0">or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this</span>
      <span class="s0">License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only</span>
      <span class="s0">on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf</span>
      <span class="s0">of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,</span>
      <span class="s0">defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability</span>
      <span class="s0">incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason</span>
      <span class="s0">of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</span>

   <span class="s0">END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</span>

   <span class="s0">APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.</span>

      <span class="s0">the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate</span>
      <span class="s0">comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a</span>
      <span class="s0">file or class name and description of purpose be included on the</span>

                            <span class="s0">2006-Jan-27</span>

          <span class="s0">David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg</span>



<span class="s0">Introduction</span>
<span class="s0">============</span>

  <span class="s0">The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;</span>
  <span class="s0">some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,</span>
  <span class="s0">various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the</span>
  <span class="s0">FreeType Project.</span>

  <span class="s0">This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and</span>
  <span class="s0">which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license</span>
  <span class="s0">affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,</span>
  <span class="s0">documentation and makefiles, at the very least.</span>

  <span class="s0">This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG</span>
  <span class="s0">(Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion</span>
  <span class="s0">and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products</span>
  <span class="s0">alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:</span>

    <span class="s0">o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be</span>
      <span class="s0">interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)</span>

    <span class="s0">o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or</span>
      <span class="s0">full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)</span>

    <span class="s0">o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use</span>
      <span class="s0">it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge</span>
      <span class="s0">somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the</span>
      <span class="s0">FreeType code. (`credits')</span>

  <span class="s0">We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this</span>
  <span class="s0">software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.</span>
  <span class="s0">We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and</span>
  <span class="s0">assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.</span>


  <span class="s0">Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a</span>
  <span class="s0">credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus</span>
  <span class="s0">encourage you to use the following text:</span>

   <span class="s0">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
    <span class="s0">Portions of this software are copyright © &lt;year&gt; The FreeType</span>
    <span class="s0">Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.</span>
   <span class="s0">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

  <span class="s0">Please replace &lt;year&gt; with the value from the FreeType version you</span>
  <span class="s0">actually use.</span>


<span class="s0">Legal Terms</span>
<span class="s0">===========</span>

<span class="s0">0. Definitions</span>
<span class="s0">--------------</span>

  <span class="s0">Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',</span>
  <span class="s0">and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally</span>
  <span class="s0">distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and</span>
  <span class="s0">Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,</span>
  <span class="s0">beta or final release.</span>

  <span class="s0">`You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where</span>
  <span class="s0">`using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source</span>
  <span class="s0">code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.</span>
  <span class="s0">This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType</span>
  <span class="s0">engine'.</span>

  <span class="s0">This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original</span>
  <span class="s0">FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and</span>
  <span class="s0">documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its</span>
  <span class="s0">original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.</span>
  <span class="s0">If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by</span>
  <span class="s0">this license, you must contact us to verify this.</span>

  <span class="s0">The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,</span>
  <span class="s0">Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as</span>
  <span class="s0">specified below.</span>

  <span class="s0">PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS</span>
  <span class="s0">BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO</span>
  <span class="s0">USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.</span>

<span class="s0">Time Zone Database</span>

  <span class="s0">ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone</span>
<span class="s0">Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database</span>
<span class="s0">is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone</span>
<span class="s0">Database section 7.</span>

 <span class="s0"># 7.  Database Ownership</span>
 <span class="s0">#</span>
 <span class="s0">#    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF</span>
 <span class="s0">#    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work</span>
 <span class="s0">#    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the</span>
 <span class="s0">#    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do</span>
 <span class="s0">#    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make</span>
 <span class="s0">#    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ</span>
 <span class="s0">#    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA</span>
 <span class="s0">#    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of</span>
 <span class="s0">#    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance</span>
 <span class="s0">#    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made</span>
 <span class="s0">#    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person</span>
 <span class="s0">#    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to</span>
 <span class="s0">#    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;You&quot; (or &quot;Your&quot;) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions granted by this License.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot; means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.</span>

<span class="s0">2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</span>

<span class="s0">3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</span>

<span class="s0">4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:</span>

     <span class="s0">(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</span>

     <span class="s0">(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and</span>

     <span class="s0">(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and</span>

     <span class="s0">(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.</span>

     <span class="s0">You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.</span>

<span class="s0">5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</span>

<span class="s0">6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</span>

<span class="s0">7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</span>

<span class="s0">8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</span>

<span class="s0">9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</span>

      <span class="s0">with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</span>

    <span class="s0">6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade</span>

      <span class="s0">whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,</span>
      <span class="s0">unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly</span>

      <span class="s0">has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</span>

    <span class="s0">9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing</span>
      <span class="s0">the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,</span>
      <span class="s0">and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,</span>
      <span class="s0">or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this</span>
      <span class="s0">License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only</span>
      <span class="s0">on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf</span>
      <span class="s0">of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,</span>

      <span class="s0">incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason</span>
      <span class="s0">of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</span>

<span class="s0">libjpeg-turbo Licenses</span>
<span class="s0">======================</span>

<span class="s0">libjpeg-turbo is covered by three compatible BSD-style open source licenses:</span>

<span class="s0">- The IJG (Independent JPEG Group) License, which is listed in</span>
  <span class="s0">[README.ijg](README.ijg)</span>

  <span class="s0">This license applies to the libjpeg API library and associated programs</span>
  <span class="s0">(any code inherited from libjpeg, and any modifications to that code.)</span>

<span class="s0">- The Modified (3-clause) BSD License, which is listed in</span>
  <span class="s0">[turbojpeg.c](turbojpeg.c)</span>

  <span class="s0">This license covers the TurboJPEG API library and associated programs.</span>

<span class="s0">- The zlib License, which is listed in [simd/jsimdext.inc](simd/jsimdext.inc)</span>

  <span class="s0">This license is a subset of the other two, and it covers the libjpeg-turbo</span>
  <span class="s0">SIMD extensions.</span>


<span class="s0">Complying with the libjpeg-turbo Licenses</span>
<span class="s0">=========================================</span>

<span class="s0">This section provides a roll-up of the libjpeg-turbo licensing terms, to the</span>
<span class="s0">best of our understanding.</span>

<span class="s0">1.  If you are distributing a modified version of the libjpeg-turbo source,</span>
    <span class="s0">then:</span>

    <span class="s0">1.  You cannot alter or remove any existing copyright or license notices</span>
        <span class="s0">from the source.</span>

        <span class="s0">**Origin**</span>
        <span class="s0">- Clause 1 of the IJG License</span>
        <span class="s0">- Clause 1 of the Modified BSD License</span>
        <span class="s0">- Clauses 1 and 3 of the zlib License</span>

    <span class="s0">2.  You must add your own copyright notice to the header of each source</span>
        <span class="s0">file you modified, so others can tell that you modified that file (if</span>
        <span class="s0">there is not an existing copyright header in that file, then you can</span>
        <span class="s0">simply add a notice stating that you modified the file.)</span>

        <span class="s0">**Origin**</span>
        <span class="s0">- Clause 1 of the IJG License</span>
        <span class="s0">- Clause 2 of the zlib License</span>

    <span class="s0">3.  You must include the IJG README file, and you must not alter any of the</span>
        <span class="s0">copyright or license text in that file.</span>

        <span class="s0">**Origin**</span>
        <span class="s0">- Clause 1 of the IJG License</span>

<span class="s0">2.  If you are distributing only libjpeg-turbo binaries without the source, or</span>
    <span class="s0">if you are distributing an application that statically links with</span>
    <span class="s0">libjpeg-turbo, then:</span>

    <span class="s0">1.  Your product documentation must include a message stating:</span>

        <span class="s0">This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG</span>
        <span class="s0">Group.</span>

        <span class="s0">**Origin**</span>
        <span class="s0">- Clause 2 of the IJG license</span>

    <span class="s0">2.  If your binary distribution includes or uses the TurboJPEG API, then</span>
        <span class="s0">your product documentation must include the text of the Modified BSD</span>
        <span class="s0">License.</span>

        <span class="s0">**Origin**</span>
        <span class="s0">- Clause 2 of the Modified BSD License</span>

<span class="s0">3.  You cannot use the name of the IJG or The libjpeg-turbo Project or the</span>
    <span class="s0">contributors thereof in advertising, publicity, etc.</span>

    <span class="s0">**Origin**</span>
    <span class="s0">- IJG License</span>
    <span class="s0">- Clause 3 of the Modified BSD License</span>

<span class="s0">4.  The IJG and The libjpeg-turbo Project do not warrant libjpeg-turbo to be</span>
    <span class="s0">free of defects, nor do we accept any liability for undesirable</span>
    <span class="s0">consequences resulting from your use of the software.</span>

    <span class="s0">**Origin**</span>
    <span class="s0">- IJG License</span>
    <span class="s0">- Modified BSD License</span>
    <span class="s0">- zlib License</span>

<span class="s0">libjpeg-turbo note:  This file has been modified by The libjpeg-turbo Project</span>
<span class="s0">to include only information relevant to libjpeg-turbo, to wordsmith certain</span>

<span class="s0">the order listed) before diving into the code.</span>


<span class="s0">OVERVIEW</span>
<span class="s0">========</span>

<span class="s0">This package contains C software to implement JPEG image encoding, decoding,</span>
<span class="s0">and transcoding.  JPEG (pronounced &quot;jay-peg&quot;) is a standardized compression</span>
<span class="s0">method for full-color and grayscale images.  JPEG's strong suit is compressing</span>
<span class="s0">photographic images or other types of images that have smooth color and</span>
<span class="s0">brightness transitions between neighboring pixels.  Images with sharp lines or</span>
<span class="s0">other abrupt features may not compress well with JPEG, and a higher JPEG</span>
<span class="s0">quality may have to be used to avoid visible compression artifacts with such</span>
<span class="s0">images.</span>

<span class="s0">JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output pixels are not necessarily identical to</span>
<span class="s0">the input pixels.  However, on photographic content and other &quot;smooth&quot; images,</span>
<span class="s0">very good compression ratios can be obtained with no visible compression</span>
<span class="s0">artifacts, and extremely high compression ratios are possible if you are</span>
<span class="s0">willing to sacrifice image quality (by reducing the &quot;quality&quot; setting in the</span>
<span class="s0">compressor.)</span>

<span class="s0">This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive</span>
<span class="s0">compression processes.  Provision is made for supporting all variants of these</span>
<span class="s0">processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren't implemented yet.</span>
<span class="s0">We have made no provision for supporting the hierarchical or lossless</span>
<span class="s0">processes defined in the standard.</span>

<span class="s0">We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files,</span>
<span class="s0">plus two sample applications &quot;cjpeg&quot; and &quot;djpeg&quot;, which use the library to</span>
<span class="s0">perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats.</span>
<span class="s0">The library is intended to be reused in other applications.</span>

<span class="s0">In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included</span>
<span class="s0">considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability;</span>
<span class="s0">for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG</span>
<span class="s0">decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or</span>
<span class="s0">colormapped displays.  These extra functions can be compiled out of the</span>
<span class="s0">library if not required for a particular application.</span>

<span class="s0">We have also included &quot;jpegtran&quot;, a utility for lossless transcoding between</span>
<span class="s0">different JPEG processes, and &quot;rdjpgcom&quot; and &quot;wrjpgcom&quot;, two simple</span>
<span class="s0">applications for inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.</span>

<span class="s0">The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and</span>
<span class="s0">flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful.  In particular,</span>
<span class="s0">the software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG.  (See the</span>
<span class="s0">REFERENCES section for introductory material.)  Rather, it is intended to</span>
<span class="s0">be reliable, portable, industrial-strength code.  We do not claim to have</span>
<span class="s0">achieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it.</span>

<span class="s0">We welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products.</span>
<span class="s0">No royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement in product</span>
<span class="s0">documentation, as described under LEGAL ISSUES.</span>

<span class="s0">==========</span>

<span class="s0">We recommend reading one or more of these references before trying to</span>
<span class="s0">understand the innards of the JPEG software.</span>

<span class="s0">The best short technical introduction to the JPEG compression algorithm is</span>
	<span class="s0">Wallace, Gregory K.  &quot;The JPEG Still Picture Compression Standard&quot;,</span>
	<span class="s0">Communications of the ACM, April 1991 (vol. 34 no. 4), pp. 30-44.</span>
<span class="s0">(Adjacent articles in that issue discuss MPEG motion picture compression,</span>
<span class="s0">applications of JPEG, and related topics.)  If you don't have the CACM issue</span>
<span class="s0">handy, a PDF file containing a revised version of Wallace's article is</span>
<span class="s0">available at http://www.ijg.org/files/Wallace.JPEG.pdf.  The file (actually</span>
<span class="s0">a preprint for an article that appeared in IEEE Trans. Consumer Electronics)</span>
<span class="s0">omits the sample images that appeared in CACM, but it includes corrections</span>
<span class="s0">and some added material.  Note: the Wallace article is copyright ACM and IEEE,</span>
<span class="s0">and it may not be used for commercial purposes.</span>

<span class="s0">A somewhat less technical, more leisurely introduction to JPEG can be found in</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;The Data Compression Book&quot; by Mark Nelson and Jean-loup Gailly, published by</span>
<span class="s0">M&amp;T Books (New York), 2nd ed. 1996, ISBN 1-55851-434-1.  This book provides</span>
<span class="s0">good explanations and example C code for a multitude of compression methods</span>
<span class="s0">including JPEG.  It is an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C</span>
<span class="s0">code but don't know much about data compression in general.  The book's JPEG</span>
<span class="s0">sample code is far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look</span>
<span class="s0">at a full implementation, you've got one here...</span>

<span class="s0">The best currently available description of JPEG is the textbook &quot;JPEG Still</span>
<span class="s0">Image Data Compression Standard&quot; by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L.</span>
<span class="s0">Mitchell, published by Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1.</span>
<span class="s0">Price US$59.95, 638 pp.  The book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG</span>
<span class="s0">standards (DIS 10918-1 and draft DIS 10918-2).</span>

<span class="s0">The original JPEG standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the actual</span>
<span class="s0">specification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods.  Part 1 is</span>
<span class="s0">titled &quot;Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images,</span>
<span class="s0">Part 1: Requirements and guidelines&quot; and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS</span>
<span class="s0">10918-1, ITU-T T.81.  Part 2 is titled &quot;Digital Compression and Coding of</span>
<span class="s0">Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 2: Compliance testing&quot; and has document</span>
<span class="s0">numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83.</span>

<span class="s0">The JPEG standard does not specify all details of an interchangeable file</span>
<span class="s0">format.  For the omitted details we follow the &quot;JFIF&quot; conventions, revision</span>
<span class="s0">1.02.  JFIF 1.02 has been adopted as an Ecma International Technical Report</span>
<span class="s0">and thus received a formal publication status.  It is available as a free</span>
<span class="s0">download in PDF format from</span>
<span class="s0">http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/techreports/E-TR-098.htm.</span>
<span class="s0">A PostScript version of the JFIF document is available at</span>
<span class="s0">http://www.ijg.org/files/jfif.ps.gz.  There is also a plain text version at</span>
<span class="s0">http://www.ijg.org/files/jfif.txt.gz, but it is missing the figures.</span>

<span class="s0">The TIFF 6.0 file format specification can be obtained by FTP from</span>
<span class="s0">ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.gz.  The JPEG incorporation scheme</span>
<span class="s0">found in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious problems.</span>
<span class="s0">IJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression tag 6).</span>
<span class="s0">Instead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technical Note #2</span>
<span class="s0">(Compression tag 7).  Copies of this Note can be obtained from</span>
<span class="s0">http://www.ijg.org/files/.  It is expected that the next revision</span>
<span class="s0">of the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note's design.</span>
<span class="s0">Although IJG's own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff library</span>
<span class="s0">uses our library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note.</span>

<span class="s0">FILE FORMAT WARS</span>
<span class="s0">================</span>

<span class="s0">The ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG1 standards committee (also known as JPEG, together</span>
<span class="s0">with ITU-T SG16) currently promotes different formats containing the name</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;JPEG&quot; which are incompatible with original DCT-based JPEG.  IJG therefore does</span>
<span class="s0">not support these formats (see REFERENCES).  Indeed, one of the original</span>
<span class="s0">reasons for developing this free software was to help force convergence on</span>
<span class="s0">common, interoperable format standards for JPEG files.</span>
<span class="s0">Don't use an incompatible file format!</span>
<span class="s0">(In any case, our decoder will remain capable of reading existing JPEG</span>
<span class="s0">image files indefinitely.)</span>

<span class="s0">purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to </span>
<span class="s0">cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, </span>
<span class="s0">or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or </span>
<span class="s0">(iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or </span>
<span class="s0">translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code, </span>
<span class="s0">generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made </span>
<span class="s0">available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or </span>
<span class="s0">attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based </span>
<span class="s0">on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, </span>
<span class="s0">elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of </span>
<span class="s0">authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works </span>
<span class="s0">that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the </span>
<span class="s0">Work and Derivative Works thereof.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the </span>
<span class="s0">Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that </span>
<span class="s0">is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner </span>
<span class="s0">or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. </span>
<span class="s0">For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot; means any form of electronic, verbal, </span>
<span class="s0">or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not </span>
<span class="s0">limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and </span>
<span class="s0">issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose </span>
<span class="s0">of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously </span>
<span class="s0">marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a </span>
<span class="s0">Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.</span>

<span class="s0">2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each </span>
<span class="s0">Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, </span>
<span class="s0">royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, </span>
<span class="s0">publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such </span>
<span class="s0">Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</span>

<span class="s0">3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each </span>
<span class="s0">Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, </span>
<span class="s0">royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, </span>
<span class="s0">have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such </span>
<span class="s0">license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are </span>
<span class="s0">necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their </span>
<span class="s0">Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You </span>
<span class="s0">institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim </span>
<span class="s0">in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work </span>
<span class="s0">constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted </span>
<span class="s0">to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation </span>
<span class="s0">is filed.</span>

<span class="s0">4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative </span>
<span class="s0">Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, </span>
<span class="s0">provided that You meet the following conditions:</span>

<span class="s0">You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this </span>
<span class="s0">License; and</span>
<span class="s0">You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed </span>
<span class="s0">the files; and</span>
<span class="s0">You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all </span>
<span class="s0">copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, </span>
<span class="s0">excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and</span>
<span class="s0">If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its distribution, then any </span>
<span class="s0">Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution </span>
<span class="s0">notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain </span>
<span class="s0">to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a </span>
<span class="s0">NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or </span>
<span class="s0">documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display </span>
<span class="s0">generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally </span>
<span class="s0">appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not </span>
<span class="s0">modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works </span>
<span class="s0">that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, </span>
<span class="s0">provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying </span>
<span class="s0">the License. </span>

<span class="s0">You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide </span>
<span class="s0">additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or </span>
<span class="s0">distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, </span>
<span class="s0">provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with </span>
<span class="s0">the conditions stated in this License.</span>

<span class="s0">5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution </span>
<span class="s0">intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under </span>
<span class="s0">the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. </span>
<span class="s0">Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any </span>
<span class="s0">separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such </span>
<span class="s0">Contributions.</span>

<span class="s0">6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, </span>
<span class="s0">trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for </span>
<span class="s0">reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the </span>
<span class="s0">content of the NOTICE file.</span>

<span class="s0">7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, </span>
<span class="s0">Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an </span>
<span class="s0">&quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, </span>
 <span class="s0">including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, </span>
 <span class="s0">MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for </span>
 <span class="s0">determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any </span>
 <span class="s0">risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</span>

<span class="s0">8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort </span>
<span class="s0">(including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such </span>
<span class="s0">as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor </span>
<span class="s0">be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or </span>
<span class="s0">consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the </span>
<span class="s0">use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of </span>
<span class="s0">goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other </span>
<span class="s0">commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the </span>
<span class="s0">possibility of such damages.</span>

<span class="s0">9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or </span>
<span class="s0">Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of </span>
<span class="s0">support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent </span>
<span class="s0">with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own </span>
<span class="s0">behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only </span>
<span class="s0">if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability </span>
<span class="s0">incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting </span>
<span class="s0">any such warranty or additional liability.</span>

      <span class="s0">granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate</span>
      <span class="s0">as of the date such litigation is filed.</span>

   <span class="s0">4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the</span>

          <span class="s0">Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</span>

      <span class="s0">(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices</span>
          <span class="s0">stating that You changed the files; and</span>

      <span class="s0">(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works</span>

          <span class="s0">excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of</span>
          <span class="s0">the Derivative Works; and</span>

      <span class="s0">(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its</span>
          <span class="s0">distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must</span>
          <span class="s0">include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained</span>
          <span class="s0">within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not</span>
          <span class="s0">pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one</span>
          <span class="s0">of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed</span>
          <span class="s0">as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or</span>
          <span class="s0">documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,</span>
          <span class="s0">within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and</span>
          <span class="s0">wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents</span>
          <span class="s0">of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and</span>
          <span class="s0">do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution</span>
          <span class="s0">notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside</span>
          <span class="s0">or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided</span>
          <span class="s0">that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed</span>
          <span class="s0">as modifying the License.</span>

      <span class="s0">You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and</span>
      <span class="s0">may provide additional or different license terms and conditions</span>
      <span class="s0">for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or</span>
      <span class="s0">for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,</span>
      <span class="s0">reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with</span>
      <span class="s0">the conditions stated in this License.</span>

   <span class="s0">5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,</span>
      <span class="s0">any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work</span>
      <span class="s0">by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of</span>
      <span class="s0">this License, without any additional terms or conditions.</span>
      <span class="s0">Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify</span>
      <span class="s0">the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed</span>
      <span class="s0">with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</span>

   <span class="s0">6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade</span>
      <span class="s0">names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,</span>
      <span class="s0">except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the</span>
      <span class="s0">origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</span>

   <span class="s0">7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or</span>
      <span class="s0">agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each</span>
      <span class="s0">Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,</span>
      <span class="s0">WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or</span>
      <span class="s0">implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions</span>
      <span class="s0">of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A</span>
      <span class="s0">PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the</span>
      <span class="s0">appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any</span>
      <span class="s0">risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</span>

   <span class="s0">8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,</span>
      <span class="s0">whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,</span>
      <span class="s0">unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly</span>
      <span class="s0">negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be</span>
      <span class="s0">liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,</span>
      <span class="s0">incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a</span>
      <span class="s0">result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the</span>
      <span class="s0">Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,</span>
      <span class="s0">work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all</span>
      <span class="s0">other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor</span>
      <span class="s0">has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</span>

   <span class="s0">9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing</span>
      <span class="s0">the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,</span>
      <span class="s0">and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,</span>
      <span class="s0">or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this</span>
      <span class="s0">License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only</span>
      <span class="s0">on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf</span>
      <span class="s0">of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,</span>
      <span class="s0">defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability</span>
      <span class="s0">incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason</span>
      <span class="s0">of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</span>

   <span class="s0">END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</span>

   <span class="s0">6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade</span>
      <span class="s0">names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,</span>

      <span class="s0">whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,</span>
      <span class="s0">unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly</span>
      <span class="s0">negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be</span>
      <span class="s0">liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,</span>
      <span class="s0">incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a</span>
      <span class="s0">result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the</span>
      <span class="s0">Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,</span>
      <span class="s0">work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all</span>
      <span class="s0">other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor</span>
      <span class="s0">has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</span>

   <span class="s0">9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing</span>
      <span class="s0">the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,</span>
      <span class="s0">and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,</span>
      <span class="s0">or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this</span>
      <span class="s0">License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only</span>
      <span class="s0">on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf</span>
      <span class="s0">of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,</span>
      <span class="s0">defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability</span>
      <span class="s0">incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason</span>
      <span class="s0">of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</span>

      <span class="s0">WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or</span>
      <span class="s0">implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions</span>
      <span class="s0">of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A</span>

   <span class="s0">8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,</span>
      <span class="s0">whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,</span>
      <span class="s0">unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly</span>

      <span class="s0">liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,</span>
      <span class="s0">incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a</span>
      <span class="s0">result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the</span>

      <span class="s0">other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor</span>
      <span class="s0">has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</span>

   <span class="s0">9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing</span>
      <span class="s0">the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,</span>
      <span class="s0">and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,</span>
      <span class="s0">or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this</span>
      <span class="s0">License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only</span>
      <span class="s0">on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf</span>
      <span class="s0">of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,</span>
      <span class="s0">defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability</span>
      <span class="s0">incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason</span>
      <span class="s0">of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</span>

<span class="s0">License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,</span>
<span class="s0">no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare</span>
<span class="s0">Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute</span>
<span class="s0">the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</span>

<span class="s0">3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,</span>
<span class="s0">each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,</span>

<span class="s0">alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such</span>
<span class="s0">Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against</span>
<span class="s0">any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging</span>
<span class="s0">that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct</span>
<span class="s0">or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You</span>
<span class="s0">under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation</span>
<span class="s0">is filed.</span>

<span class="s0">4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or</span>
<span class="s0">Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and</span>
<span class="s0">in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:</span>

<span class="s0">of this License; and</span>

<span class="s0">(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that</span>
<span class="s0">You changed the files; and</span>

<span class="s0">(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute,</span>
<span class="s0">all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source</span>
<span class="s0">form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part</span>
<span class="s0">of the Derivative Works; and</span>

<span class="s0">(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its distribution,</span>
<span class="s0">then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy</span>
<span class="s0">of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those</span>
<span class="s0">notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least</span>
<span class="s0">one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part</span>
<span class="s0">of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided</span>
<span class="s0">along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative</span>
<span class="s0">Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents</span>
<span class="s0">of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the</span>
<span class="s0">License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works</span>
<span class="s0">that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the</span>
<span class="s0">Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed</span>
<span class="s0">as modifying the License.</span>

<span class="s0">You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide</span>
<span class="s0">additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction,</span>
<span class="s0">or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as</span>
<span class="s0">a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise</span>
<span class="s0">complies with the conditions stated in this License.</span>

<span class="s0">5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any</span>
<span class="s0">Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the</span>
<span class="s0">Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without</span>
<span class="s0">any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein</span>
<span class="s0">shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you</span>
<span class="s0">may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</span>

<span class="s0">6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,</span>
<span class="s0">trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required</span>
<span class="s0">for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and</span>
<span class="s0">reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</span>

<span class="s0">7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to</span>
<span class="s0">in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its</span>
<span class="s0">Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY</span>
<span class="s0">KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties</span>
<span class="s0">or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR</span>
<span class="s0">A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness</span>
<span class="s0">of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your</span>
<span class="s0">exercise of permissions under this License.</span>

<span class="s0">8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether</span>
<span class="s0">in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by</span>
<span class="s0">applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to</span>
<span class="s0">in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including</span>
<span class="s0">any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any</span>
<span class="s0">character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability</span>
<span class="s0">to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,</span>
<span class="s0">work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial</span>

<span class="s0">sqlite</span>

<span class="s0">The source code for SQLite is in the public domain. No claim of</span>
<span class="s0">copyright is made on any part of the core source code. (The</span>
<span class="s0">documentation and test code is a different matter - some sections of</span>
<span class="s0">documentation and test logic are governed by open-source licenses.)</span>
<span class="s0">All contributors to the SQLite core software have signed affidavits</span>
<span class="s0">specifically disavowing any copyright interest in the code. This means</span>
<span class="s0">that anybody is able to legally do anything they want with the SQLite</span>
<span class="s0">source code.</span>

<span class="s0">There are other SQL database engines with liberal licenses that allow</span>
<span class="s0">the code to be broadly and freely used. But those other engines are</span>
<span class="s0">still governed by copyright law. SQLite is different in that copyright</span>
<span class="s0">law simply does not apply.</span>

<span class="s0">The source code files for other SQL database engines typically begin</span>
<span class="s0">with a comment describing your legal rights to view and copy that</span>
<span class="s0">file. The SQLite source code contains no license since it is not</span>
<span class="s0">governed by copyright. Instead of a license, the SQLite source code</span>
<span class="s0">offers a blessing:</span>

<span class="s0">May you do good and not evil</span>
<span class="s0">May you find forgiveness for yourself and forgive others</span>
<span class="s0">May you share freely, never taking more than you give.</span>

      <span class="s0">Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,</span>
      <span class="s0">work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all</span>
      <span class="s0">other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor</span>
      <span class="s0">has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</span>

   <span class="s0">9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing</span>
      <span class="s0">the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,</span>
      <span class="s0">and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,</span>
      <span class="s0">or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this</span>
      <span class="s0">License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only</span>
      <span class="s0">on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf</span>
      <span class="s0">of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,</span>
      <span class="s0">defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability</span>
      <span class="s0">incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason</span>
      <span class="s0">of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</span>

      <span class="s0">(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its</span>

          <span class="s0">wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents</span>
          <span class="s0">of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and</span>
          <span class="s0">do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution</span>
          <span class="s0">notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside</span>
          <span class="s0">or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided</span>
          <span class="s0">that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed</span>
          <span class="s0">as modifying the License.</span>

      <span class="s0">You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and</span>
      <span class="s0">may provide additional or different license terms and conditions</span>
      <span class="s0">for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or</span>
      <span class="s0">for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,</span>
      <span class="s0">reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with</span>
      <span class="s0">the conditions stated in this License.</span>

    <span class="s0">5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,</span>

      <span class="s0">the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed</span>
      <span class="s0">with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</span>

    <span class="s0">6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade</span>
      <span class="s0">names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,</span>
      <span class="s0">except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the</span>
      <span class="s0">origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</span>

    <span class="s0">7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or</span>

      <span class="s0">risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</span>

    <span class="s0">8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,</span>
      <span class="s0">whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,</span>
      <span class="s0">unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly</span>
      <span class="s0">negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be</span>
      <span class="s0">liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,</span>
      <span class="s0">incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a</span>
      <span class="s0">result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the</span>
      <span class="s0">Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,</span>
      <span class="s0">work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all</span>
      <span class="s0">other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor</span>
      <span class="s0">has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</span>

    <span class="s0">9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing</span>
      <span class="s0">the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,</span>
      <span class="s0">and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,</span>
      <span class="s0">or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this</span>
      <span class="s0">License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only</span>
      <span class="s0">on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf</span>
      <span class="s0">of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,</span>
      <span class="s0">defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability</span>
      <span class="s0">incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason</span>
      <span class="s0">of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</span>
